# UCEtoDFOIL
This code is for filtering UCE data to remove positions with missing data and heterozygous bases to be useful as DFOIL input. DFOIL uses unphased .fasta files, so I removed any positions that would have resulted in an ambiguity code due to heterozygosity.

This was for a specific project and is not meant to be a program. Feel free to adapt this if it helps you.
